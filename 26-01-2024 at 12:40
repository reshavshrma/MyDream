/*Let's solve a simple problem.
Write a program in the IDE which does the following

Accepts the count of test cases - t - as an integer input given in the 1st line.
This is followed by t lines - Each line contains an integer N
For each test cases, prints out the integer N to console on a separate line (our Input mirror problem*/


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
 int t;
 //accept the count of test cases given in the the 1st line
 cin>>t;
 //Run a loop to accept 't' inputs
while(t--)
 { 
   int N;
 //accept an integer N in each test case
   cin >> N;
 //output the number mirror for each test case
   cout << N << endl;
  }  
 
}
