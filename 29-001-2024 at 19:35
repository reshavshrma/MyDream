/* Lets start with a simple problem - you need to write a program which does the following

Accepts the number of inputs / test cases as t 
The only line of each test case contains 2 integers - declare them as variables - A and B
For each test case, you need to perform the following operations
Create a variable -S - the sum of the 2 input integers
Create a variable - P - the product of the 2 input integers
Output 2 space separated integers - S and P in a single line . */
