/* Let's solve this practice problem.

You will attend tuitions for X weeks, and the cost of tuition per week is Y dollars.
You need to compute and output your total tuition fees.
he first line of input will contain an integer T â€” the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers - X and Y *

import java.util.Scanner;

class CodeChef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = read.nextInt();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
            
            int x = read.nextInt();
            int y = read.nextInt();
            
            System.out.println(x*y);
        }
    }
}
