/* Let's write a program in the IDE which performs the following

The 1st line of input is an integer - T - the count of test cases
Each test case consists of 2 lines of input
The 1st line of input has 2 space separated integers - accept them as variables a and b
The 2nd line of input has 3 space separated integers - accept them as variables c, d and e
For each test case - output all integers on a single line */
